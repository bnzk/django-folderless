django-folderless
*****************

simple media manager for django - you won't need those folders.

nevertheless, many similiar things already exist. no wonder this project is heavily experienced by https://github.com/stefanfoulis/django-filer, and to some extent, feincms.module.medialibrary and https://github.com/samluescher/django-media-tree.

initial idea credits: https://github.com/wullerot/ (manipulated django-filer to hide folders completely).

this project will use http://semver.org when ready.
